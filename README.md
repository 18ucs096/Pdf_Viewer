# Custom_Pdf_Viewer
Custom PDF viewer built with pdf.js It also has pagination feature. 
If you want to use it just fork this repository. 
If you want to check how it works, just visit:- https://pdf-viewer-app.netlify.app/  
NOTE:- pdf must be placed at same origin. Cross-origin is not supported by browsers due to security issue.
I recommend to test using VSCode live server or any other live server whichever you like to test this.
